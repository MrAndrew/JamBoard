JamBoard
======

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

You can look at the Documentation for React at their site. This project used **React.js** to 
create a web app that allows a user to make playlists for thier [Spotify Account](https://www.spotify.com/) 
and search through Spotify's library using different paramaters.

A live version of the site can be seen at jamboard.surge.sh
